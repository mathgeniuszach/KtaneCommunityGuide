This guide is public domain (under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)), but credits are always appreciated.<br> It was written by [mathgeniuszach](https://gist.github.com/mathgeniuszach) with help from the KTaNE community.

This guide assumes you have some experience with [vanilla (unmodded)](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla) KTaNE. That is, you or someone you know owns the game and you've played at least a little bit of section 1, either as a [Defuser](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser) or an [Expert](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert).

## Edgework and Readouts

When playing with others, the first thing you may want to understand is the concept of [edgework](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#edgework). You may be used to asking questions like, "What's the last digit of the serial number?" or "How many batteries exist on the bomb?", but for many [modded](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod) [bombs](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb), its common practice for the [Defuser](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser) to read out all information about the bomb before starting. Information usually is read out in this order:

- {number of [batteries](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#battery)} in {number of [battery holders](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#battery-holder)},
- lit {[indicator](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#indicator)}, unlit {indicator}, ...
- [port plate](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#port-plate) with {[ports](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#port)}, port plate with {ports}, ...
- {[serial number](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#serial-number)},
- etc.

A good way to check if you got everything is to count the total number of [widgets](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#widget). This is normally equal to five, unless you downloaded a [mod](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod) and changed it. On the [Challenge Bombs Site](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#challenge-bombs-site) (see ["Samfun.dev Leaderboard" under Competition](#samfun-dev-leaderboard) for more info), the number of widgets is directly mentioned for each [modded](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod) [mission](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mission).

<summary id="vanilla-edgework-tricks"><b>Vanilla Edgework Tricks</b></summary>

In <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla (unmodded)</a>, you don't need a full readout of all the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#edgework">edgework</a> on the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bomb</a>. Rather, you only need six pieces of information, which may help make your <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solve">solves</a> go faster:

```
How many batteries are on the bomb?
Does the serial number contain a vowel?
Is the last digit of the serial number odd or even?
Does the bomb contain a parallel port?
Is there a lit CAR indicator?
Is there a lit FRK indicator?
```

<summary id="the-nato-phonetic-alphabet"><b>The NATO Phonetic Alphabet</b></summary>

For maximum clarity when speaking online between people across cultures and accents, it may be helpful to employ the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO Phonetic Alphabet</a>. This is a set of clear-code words which can be used instead of words like "Nine", "Three", "Dee", and "Bee" (which in the NATO alphabet are "Niner", "Tree", "Delta", and "Bravo"), which are more distinct than typical pronounciations of the letters or numbers.

<summary id="international-morse-code"><b>International Morse Code</b></summary>

If you're struggling with Morse Code, don't worry. Everyone does at first. It's important that you pay attention to both the amount of time the light is on, and the amount of time the light is off. The ordinary Morse Code <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">module</a> beats at a rate of (I think 195.5) bpm (or (I think 3.9) wpm), if you want to open a metronome. Here's some helpful timing guidelines:

- A dot is on for one beat, and off for one beat.
- A dash is on for three beats, then off for one beat.
- The light is off for two extra beats between letters.
- The light is off for six extra beats at the end of a word.

Learning and memorizing International Morse Code is a useful skill which will help you continually in <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla (unmodded)</a> and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">modded</a> KTaNE. If you would like to learn Morse Code, here are some helpful resources to do so:

- <a href="https://morsecode.world/international">Morse Code World</a> - Morse Code training tools and an extended chart, with a focus on speed and real world usage.
- <a href="https://morse.withgoogle.com/learn">Google's Morse Code Training</a> - A more mnemonics focused site for learning Morse Code. Helpful if you want a more casual approach.
- <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code_mnemonics">Wikipedia Morse Code mnemonics</a> - More mnemonics for Morse Code.

<summary id="port-shorthand"><b>Port Shorthand</b></summary>

The best and shortest way to refer to various <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#port">port</a> types is by using the following acronyms: RCA (for Stereo RCA), DVI (for DVI-D), PS2 (for PS/2), RJ (for RJ-45), PAR/Parallel (for Parallel), and SER/Serial (for Serial).

<summary id="recording-edgework"><b>Recording Edgework</b></summary>

If you are playing as an <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Expert</a>, you'll need to write down any <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#edgework">edgework</a> that is read out to you. For a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bomb</a> with 8 <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#widget">widgets</a>, containing one D <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#battery">battery</a>, 4 AA batteries, an unlit CAR and lit FRK <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#indicator">indicator</a>, a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#port-plate">port plate</a> with a serial and parallel <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#port">port</a>, another port plate with a PS/2, Stereo RCA, DVI-D, and RJ-45 port, and another port plate that has no ports on it, here are some ways that people record this edgework:

<summary id="soloing-and-efming"><b>Soloing and EFMing</b></summary>

At the start of every <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bomb</a>, there's a rule which appears on the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defuser</a>'s screen:

> This screen is for your eyes only.<br>
> You are not allowed to look at the Bomb Defusal Manual.

After all, KTaNE is a game about cooperation, and if you could look at the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">Manual</a>, that would defeat the whole point of working together, right? Well, sometimes. But if you're familiar with the concept of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#needy-module">needy modules</a>, sometimes it can be more fun if the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defuser</a> has something to do on their own while waiting on the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Experts</a> too!

This has brought about the concept of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solo">soloing</a>, where a Defuser memorizes the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manuals</a> of some <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a> (to avoid looking at them), and solves them on their own while the Experts do other things. This is already a thing in <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla</a> (e.g. see <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Capacitor%20Discharge.html">Capacitor Discharge</a> or <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Venting%20Gas.html">Venting Gas</a>), so it's widely accepted in the community to do this, even on competitive bombs.

Still, it may not always be feasible to get enough people to play KTaNE. But does that mean you can't play at all? Of course not! In this scenario, people forgo the above rule and look at manuals anyway. This is known as <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#experting-for-myself">Experting for Myself</a> or EFMing. Despite it not being in the spirit of the original game, this is a great way to learn new modules, and it can still be a fun and difficult challenge with tight timers!

So long as you're being honest about it and tagging your <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solve">solves</a> as such, EFMing is widely accepted even in competitive play.

<summary id="computing-the-number-of-d-and-aa-batteries"><b>Computing the Number of D and AA Batteries</b></summary>

It's common for most <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defusers</a> to give the number of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#battery">batteries</a> and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#battery-holder">battery holders</a>, but not the number of D and AA batteries. If for any reason you need to compute or compare them (and you do not have any <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">mods</a> adding other types of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#widget">widgets</a>), here are some formulas that can help you (D is the number of D batteries, AA is the number of AA batteries, B is the total number of batteries, and H is the total number of battery holders):

- `AA = 2(B - H)`
- `D = 2H - B`
- `AA < D === B < H + ⅓H`
- `D = B - AA`
- `AA = B - D`

Alternatively, you can consider reading out the number of AA and D batteries separately, like "4 plus 1 in 3", instead of "5 in 3".

## Looking for a Game or Group?

If you have no one to play with but still want to play KTaNE, don't worry, the community has you covered! Join the [KTaNE Discord Server](https://discord.gg/K6uQMyBcYZ). Now, open the [#lfg-instructions](https://discord.com/channels/160061833166716928/835191870162206760) channel and read the instructions, or keep reading here.

There are four roles you can ping in the [#looking-for-game](https://discord.com/channels/160061833166716928/217944579234725888) channel in the Discord, which follow this structure:

> @LFG \[[Vanilla](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla)/[Modded](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod)\] \[[Expert](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert)/[Defuser](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser)\]

Ping the role of the person you need, not who you are.<br>
In other words, if you are an Expert looking for a Defuser, ping "Defuser".

## Modding

Modding is the process of adding [mods](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod) (short for modifications) - adding new content or challenges - to the game. KTaNE mods are simple to install and use - simply click the "subscribe" button on the mod you're interested in on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/341800/workshop), and Steam will automatically download and install it into your game. You can also subscribe to entire collections of mods, which include many mods inside of them.

<details>
<summary id="quality-of-life-qol-and-performance-boosts"><b>Quality of Life (QoL) and Performance Boosts</b></summary>

To get the most out of your game, here are some tweaks that can help you:

1. Close out the game, if you have it open.
2. Open your `playerSettings.xml` file in any text editor. It can normally be found in one of these locations:<br><br>
   <table>
      <tr><td>Windows</td><td><code>%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Steel Crate Games\Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\playerSettings.xml</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>MacOS</td><td><code>~/Library/Application Support/com.steelcrategames.keeptalkingandnobodyexplodes/playerSettings.xml</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Linux</td><td><code>~/.config/unity3d/Steel Crate Games/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/playerSettings.xml</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Steam Deck (Proton)</td><td><code>~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/341800/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Steel Crate Games/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/playerSettings.xml</code></td></tr>
   </table>
3. Change `<LockMouseToWindow>true` to `<LockMouseToWindow>false`. This will allow you to move your mouse in and out of the game (when it is in windowed mode) without needing to Alt+Tab.
4. Change `<UseParallelModLoading>false` to `<UseParallelModLoading>true`. This will allow mods to use CPU parallelization to load faster by loading at the same time.
5. Change `<UseModsAlways>false` to `<UseModsAlways>true`, and `<SkipTitleScreen>false` to `<SkipTitleScreen>true`. This will skip the initial "Disable Mods/Enable Mods" screen so you can load the game with less clicks.
6. Save the file and close it.
7. Go to [KTaNE Web Utils' modSettings.xml Generator](https://nicklatkovich.github.io/ktane-web-utils/mod-settings) and generate a new `modSettings.xml` file to replace the one next to the `playerSettings.xml` file. This will stop the game from enabling modules automatically and let [DBML](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#demand-based-mod-loading) (enabled in step #9) handle them instead. You may need to do this periodically as new mods are released on the Steam Workshop.
8. Subscribe to this collection of mods: [KTaNE Utility and QoL](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2993222638). You may also find more Utility and QoL mods in the [Other Category of the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=341800&requiredtags[]=Other). For example, you may like [Bomb Timer Modifier](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2413322108).
9. Launch the game, and pick up the tablet on the table. Open the `Mod Settings` app, and select `Tweaks`. Scroll down until you see `Demand Based Mod Loading (DBML)` and `Replace Obsolete Mods`. Check both of these. This will automatically load any mods you have downloaded if they're needed for a bomb.
10. If you want to have every single mod downloaded and ready for any bomb that could possibly exist, also check `Subscribe to New Mods`, and Subscribe to [The Full KTaNE Experience (REMAKE) [Part 1]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844573543), [The Full KTaNE Experience (REMAKE) [Part 2]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844590516), and any other parts that may exist in the future.
11. Restart your game.

<summary id="log-file-analyzer"><b>Log File Analyzer</b></summary>

The <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Logfile%20Analyzer.html">Log File Analyzer</a> is a tool which analyzes your game's <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#logfile">logfile</a> to show what happened on each <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bomb</a> in your game session, including the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a> you <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#strike">striked</a> on and their correct solutions.

Instead of uploading your logfile manually, it's recommended that you subscribe to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1358839759">Log Viewer Hotkey</a> mod, which adds some new shortcuts to the game:

- Shift+F7 will open just the last bomb in the Log File Analyzer.
- Shift+F8 will open your full logfile in the Log File Analyzer.
- Control+Shift+F8 will upload your full logfile to the Log File Analyzer and copy a link to the page.
- Shift+F9 will clear your logfile, removing any recorded bombs.

<summary id="using-the-repository-of-manual-pages"><b>Using the Repository of Manual Pages</b></summary>

The central hub for all <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manuals</a>, <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla</a> or <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">modded</a>, is the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de">Repository of Manual Pages (https://ktane.timwi.de)</a>. This repository lets you search for, filter, and sort between different <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a> and their <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manuals</a>.

Next to every module there is also a blue triangle pointing downward with the word "MORE" written above it. Click on this triangle to select alternative manuals, such as optimized, reworded, interactive, or translated manuals. For some modules, the reworded or interactive manuals may be easier to read or use than the original (e.g., compare <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Hexamaze.html">Hexamaze</a> with <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Hexamaze%20interactive%20(samfundev).html">Hexamaze interactive</a>, and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Orientation Cube.html">Orientation Cube</a> with <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Orientation%20Cube%20optimized%20(CaitSith2).html">Orientation Cube optimized</a>). Selecting a different manual will save your choice and make it so the next time you open the manual, it opens the alternative one instead.

Note that some alternative manuals trivialize certain modules too much, so the community has decided to ban them for competitive play. These are called CBS-restricted manuals - you can filter them out by unchecking the checkbox in the "Options" tab.

For most gameplay usage, you may find it useful to change the sort order in the repository (under the "Filters" tab) to "Sort by date published" in "Reverse". This makes the oldest (i.e., the "non-variant") modules show up first when you search them by name, which is typically what you want.

<summary id="ruleseeding"><b>Ruleseeding</b></summary>

One of the best ways of getting into modded KTaNE is by using alternative <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#rule-seed">rule seeds</a>. This is actually a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla</a> feature, but it is normally impossible to change the rule seed without using a mod like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2037350348">Rule Seed Modifier</a>.

Rule seeds shuffle the rules in every <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manual</a> slightly to provide more of a challenge for <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Experts</a> and to prevent <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defuser</a> memorization. For example, compare the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Password.html">vanilla Password manual (rule seed #1)</a> with a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Password.html#2"> ruleseeded Password manual (rule seed #2)</a>. The words are changed, but the underlying rules of the module stay the same.

You can access rule seeded manuals on the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de">Repository of Manual Pages</a> by clicking the `Rule Seed` button in the top right, and typing in the rule seed you want to use. Just keep in mind that rule seed #1 is the vanilla rules, and that many alternative manuals do not support rule seeds.

Only some <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">mods</a> and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a> support rule seeds. When you have a rule seed active on the Repository of Manual Pages, modules supporting rule seeds will have a wrench next to the blue triangle on the right.

<a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#profile-bomb">Profile bombs</a> are the community's version of randomized "freeplay". They make use of both <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#profile">profiles</a> and the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1633427044">Dynamic Mission Generator</a> mod to create custom <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bombs</a> with a certain number of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a> for each <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Expert</a> (and sometimes some modules for the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defuser</a> to <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solo">solo</a>).

Profiles are simply a list of modules an Expert or Defuser is comfortable with (enabled modules) and uncomfortable with (disabled modules). You can create a profile (<code>.json</code> file) by using the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Profile%20Editor.html">Profile Editor</a> on the repository. Usually each Expert has their own <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert-profile">Expert-mode profile</a> which selects modules they want on the bomb, and the Defuser has a special <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser-profile">Defuser-mode profile</a> which can either add a few more modules or veto (forcibly remove) other modules they don't like.
   
To create a profile bomb, a defuser will import all profiles (<code>.json</code> files) into their game by placing them in their <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod-profiles-folder">ModProfiles</a> folder. Then, they'll open the Dynamic Mission Generator app and enter a DMG string like these:

- `5*profile:Mickey 5*profile:Brian 1*profile:Solos`<br>Adds 5 random modules from Mickey's profile, 5 random modules from Brian's profile, and 1 extra random module from the defuser's profile. This bomb will have 3 strikes (1 strike per 12 <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#regular-module">regular modules</a> with a minimum of 3) and 22 minutes (2 minutes per regular module).
- `24*profile:Mickey 24*profile:Brian 1*profile:Solos 1:00:00`<br>Adds 24 random modules from Mickey and Brian's profiles, and 1 extra random module from the defuser's profile. This bomb will have 4 strikes and 1 hour.

## Competition
If you enjoy trying to reach the top [leaderboard](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#leaderboard) times for various [missions](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mission), you may enjoy the competitive side of KTaNE. Unfortunately, the [Steam Leaderboard](http://steamcommunity.com/stats/341800/leaderboards) is fairly limited in functionality, so the KTaNE community uses three different leaderboards instead.

<details>
<summary id="speedrun-com-leaderboard"><b>Speedrun.com Leaderboard</b></summary>

For all <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#vanilla">vanilla</a> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mission">missions</a>, the best place to submit your <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solve">solve</a> times is the <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/ktane">speedrun.com leaderboard (https://www.speedrun.com/ktane)</a>. There are categories for full game runs and individual missions on PC, Console, Mobile, and VR.

The times submitted here are really competitive though, so to get a good time you'll have to either <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solo">solo</a> all of the modules or <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#experting-for-myself">EFM</a>, both of which are allowed by the rules. You'll also need to learn how to solve the bomb before the lights turn on, as RTA timing starts when "Loading..." disappears from the bottom right corner.

Otherwise known as the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#challenge-bombs-site">Challenge Bombs Site (CBS)</a>, https://bombs.samfun.dev/ is where you can submit your <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solve">solve</a> times for every substantial <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">modded</a> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mission">mission</a>. Individual user leaderboards can be found <a href="https://bombs.samfun.dev/solvers">here</a>.

Both <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solo">soloing</a> and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#experting-for-myself">EFMing</a> are allowed by the rules, provided you tag your solves properly.

<a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#twitch-plays-ktane">Twitch Plays: KTaNE</a> works a little differently than the base game. Instead of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Experts</a> telling a <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defuser</a> what to do, all players act as Experts and issue commands through the chat on a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a> livestream. Because all players can see both the game and the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manual</a>, this is a special form of <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#experting-for-myself">Experting for Myself</a>.

Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/hZcUK59">Twitch Plays: KTaNE Discord Server</a> to find streams running this gamemode, or run it yourself with the software you can <a href="https://github.com/samfundev/KtaneTwitchPlays/wiki/Latest-Build">find here</a>.

<summary id="additional-challenges"><b>Additional Challenges</b></summary>

If you're interested in some <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#challenge">special challenges</a> which can make <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#bomb">bomb</a> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#solve">solving</a> more fun for <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#defuser">Defusers</a> and <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#expert">Experts</a>, or just would like get more out of the game besides adding new <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#mod">modded</a> <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#manual">manuals</a> or <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#module">modules</a>, here's a few you can try:

- **Yes/No**<br>In this challenge, one or more players may only say yes or no (usually only the defuser), and it's up to the other players to strategically ask the right questions to obtain information.
- **Clown Car**<br>In this challenge, two or more defusers playing different bombs join the same voice channel, potentially sharing experts.
- **Upside Down**<br>In this challenge, one or more players flip either their manuals or the game upside down.
- **Elevator**<br>The <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#elevator">Elevator</a> is a special <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#gameplay-room">gameplay room</a> which is only accessible by flipping a switch under the desk (this switch can only be flipped in either VR or with the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3477652427">Camera Mover</a> mod).
- **Endurance**<br><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#endurance">Endurance</a> is not so much a challenge as it is a gamemode. Using the <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#factory">Factory mod</a> (and potentially <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#dynamic-mission-generator">Dynamic Mission Generator</a>), the defuser solves bombs until they either <a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#explode">explode</a> or solve a certain number of bombs.
- **Ruleseeded**<br><a href="https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Glossary.html#rule-seed">Rule Seeds</a> (explained <a href="#ruleseeding">earlier in this guide</a>), modify the manuals of certain modules slightly to prevent defuser and expert memorization.
